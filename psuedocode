Step 1: setup 
	originalList[1] becomes array of finalStates 
	originalList[2] becomes array of startState
	originalList[3] becomes array of alphabet 
	originalList[0] becomes array of states with each state repeated * alphabet 

	For originalList[5] to end of originalList[]: 
		states[current state] = transitions[transition, new state] 



Step 2: expansion 
	for states[current state]: #vgo through each possibility 
		# follow all emp to end states (recursive) 
		states[currentstate][trans].append = follow(states, current state, transition) 

	for all states 
		if (states[i][j].length > 1) 
			reorder numerically nested array 



follow(states, cs, t): #follow down the tree to each possible path from each state 
	newState = states[cs][t]
	for (all trans in states[newState])
		if (trans == emp) #continue branching if an empty transition 
			return(follow(states, states[newState][trans], t)) 
		else if (trans == t) #stop if not an empty path 
			return newState



Step 3: #for all states not in the original set 
	for length of states[] 
		increment transition 
			if (states[i][j].length > 1) #meaning it has another embedded array 
				states.append(states[i][j]) # as a new element alphabet number of times 
				# states's new name is incremented from last state 
				$$$$ COME BACK 
				# add any state with the original final state(s) to finalState list 
				finalStates.append(newState) 


Step 4: # start from initial state and construct DFA 
	DFA[][] 
	s = startState
	while s != empty 
		for each transition 
			DFA[i][t] = states[s][t]
			if states[s][t] not in s
				s.append(states[s][t]) 
	# reconstructed DFA from initial state 


$$COME BACK 
Step 5: # Minimize DFA with Hopcroft 
	# initial set up for two sets 
	for all states in DFA 
		if DFA state also in finalStates 
			SetA.append(state) 
		else 
			SetB.append(state) 
	for
